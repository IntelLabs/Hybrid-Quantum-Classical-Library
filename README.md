Hybrid Quantum-Classical Library (HQCL)

A high-level library to automate the execution of Hybrid Quantum-Classical algorithms with the Intel(R) Quantum SDK. The library allows the user a high degree of programmability in defining and manipulating hybrid algorithms during runtime, while maintaining the faster program execution of the fully compiled (as opposed to transpiled) Intel quantum stack.

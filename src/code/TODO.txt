Functions and modules to add:

VQE-related
- Get <P> for single Pauli
- Get {<P_i>} for group of Paulis
- Put the Paulis into groups {P_i}
- Get <A> for full op
- (all of the above take epsilon as input)

QAOA-related
- Collect N bitstrings
- Get costs
- Calculate QAOA cost functions
   - Best cost
   - Average cost

Circuit & ansatzae
- QUESTION: How much of this is already built-in?
- QUESTION: Can we write code that *compiles circuits on the fly* (since we might need to do that in the meantime?)
- FIRST VERSION - Make abstract circuit object (separate simulator if need be)
- Parameterizable gate class
- Parameterizable circuit class
- Circuit layers [For layered C-A-B, A-B-C, etc…]
- Methods for modifying circuit
- Remove/add gates in arbitrary places
- Techniques like adapt-VQE



Outer optimization loop
- Intel® MKL / Intel® DAL
